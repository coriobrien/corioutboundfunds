Outbound Funds Module is a foundational solution for foundations and nonprofits who disburse awards and grants to track their funding programs and requests, gain insight on financial commitments and manage disbursements. It is free and open source.

This package is designed to work with all Salesforce instances and NPSP is not a requirement.

**Important note about Funding Requests as of July 2019**:
If you were an early adopter of the Outbound Funds package, the Funding Request object had a master-detail relationship with Funding Program when you installed it. However, various members of the community requested that this relationship be changed to a lookup to provide more flexibility. This change was made generally available with package version 1.15 as of 7/11/2019. To learn about updating to version 1.15, see the [Funding Request Object documentation](https://powerofus.force.com/s/article/OFM-Documentation).

The Outbound Funds Module was originally conceived, designed, and built with love by our Open Source Community as part of the Open Source Commons program between 2016 - 2020. Salesforce.org fulfilled the project team’s original goal to have the solution adopted as an “official product” in May 2020, and it continues to be developed and maintained in partnership between the OFM advisory council and Salesforce.org. There are so many incredible open source volunteers who’ve contributed to this project over the years, but a very special thank you to the core project team Bill Corkill, Shari Carlson, Nick Lindberg, & Sarah Amin.
